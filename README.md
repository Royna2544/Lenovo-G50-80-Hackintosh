3. Insert a USB to Mac or VM and connect it. Take note of the USB name. 

4-1. execute "sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Catalina.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/(Your USB device name) (If you want to install macOS Catalina)

4-2. execute "sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Big\ Sur\ Beta.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/(Your USB device name) (If you want to install macOS Big Sur Beta)

5. Enter password of root (WARNING: THIS WILL WIPE DATA ON THE SELECTED DRIVE. BE EXTRA CAREFUL)
6. Wait until the making of bootable macOS Drive finishs 
7. Mount the USB's EFI using ESP Mounter Pro or any other EFI mounter, copy and paste the EFI Folder in releases page. (Note : the structure should be /EFI/EFI/OC, /EFI/EFI/BOOT)
8. In the PC that you want to run Macintosh, enter Boot Menu and boot from USB
9. As some texts passes, just wait.
10. If the installer appears, then you're in the right place. Go to disk utility and Wipe the Disk as APFS. (WARNING: THIS WILL WIPE DATA ON THE SELECTED DRIVE. BE EXTRA CAREFUL)
11. Exit the disk utility and install macOS as instructed.
12. The computer will reboot 2~3 times. This is very normal and just select 'preboot' on every bootloader menu. 
13. If it was successful, the mac setup screen will appear.
